       <p>This is a clone of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%28game%29" target="_blank">Simon musical memory game</a>.</p>
       <p>Tap to start. Listen carefully to the musical sequence and play it again tapping on the sides of the cube. Each side has a color (displayed on the top side) and each color is associated to a sound. If you played exactly the same sequence, a nex note is added to the sequence and you must play again the whole sequence from the begining. You loose when you make a mistake.<p>
